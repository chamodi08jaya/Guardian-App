Ensure that women feel much safer and improved mobility around cities with the help of safety related authorities.


Late night travelling is a hard task for women.
Being unware of emergency contact ponts,we used a wristband button press away.
In there we transmit the location of the person using GPS transmit to the pre selected contacts and emergency contact places like police station.

In there we can discretely record the audio and video of the situation.
Immediately send that recorded data to the emergency contacts and store the data as evidance in the cloud.
